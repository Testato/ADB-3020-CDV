# ADB-3020-CDV

The ADB-3020 is an excellent switching power supply designed by an Italian team and licensed under Creative Commons (the original project and credits are in the adb_2030_Original subfolder).

The CDV (Community Digital Version) fork is intended to start with version 2.1 (last published on the fork date) and then extend it with digital functions via MCU.
The project starts with the creation of Eagle .sch and .brd files because the original authors have decided not to release those files.

The CDV version is released under the same license as the original project:
